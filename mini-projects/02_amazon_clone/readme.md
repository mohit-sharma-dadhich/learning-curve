# Amazon Clone

This is a web-based **Amazon clone** project built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates a static e-commerce interface with core shopping features. The design emphasizes a clean, responsive UI and lists products by category. Users can add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and see the total update in real-time â€” all without a backend, using localStorage.
