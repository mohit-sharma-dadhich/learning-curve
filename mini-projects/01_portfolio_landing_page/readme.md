# ðŸ’¼ Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is my **Portfolio Website** project focused on practicing and applying HTML and CSS fundamentals while building a visually appealing and structured portfolio page.

The webpage includes:
- A responsive navigation bar
- Intro section with personal introduction and image
- About Me section
- Project cards with images and descriptions
- Contact section with email, phone, and location details
- Clean footer with copyright

## What I Learned
- Structuring HTML pages using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
- Linking external stylesheets and maintaining separation of concerns
- Using **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid** layout techniques to align and distribute elements
- Styling circular profile images with `border-radius`
- Applying **box shadows**, **text shadows**, and **hover effects** for better UI/UX
- Creating scrollable project cards using `overflow-y: auto`
- Layering content with `z-index` and pseudo-elements like `::before`
- Using `mailto:` and `tel:` links for easy contact interactions
- Designing without media queries while ensuring desktop responsiveness

## Project Goals
- Practice real-world HTML/CSS layout structure
- Learn to combine multiple sections into a single cohesive webpage
- Begin working on a personal portfolio that can be expanded later

## To Do Next
- Add **media queries** to support mobile and tablet devices
- Replace placeholder content with actual project links and images
- Deploy the site using **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**
- Add animations and form interactivity with JavaScript
