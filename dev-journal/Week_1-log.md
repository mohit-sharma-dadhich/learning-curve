# Week 1 Log: HTML & CSS

### Day-01 : Profile_card

## âœ… What I Learned

- Basic HTML structure and semantic tags
- Linking external CSS using `<link>`
- Using Flexbox for layout:
  - `display: flex;`
  - `justify-content: center;`
  - `align-items: center;`
- Centering elements vertically and horizontally with `height: 100vh`
- Making images circular using `border-radius: 50%` and `object-fit: cover`
- Styling buttons and adding hover effects

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Do **not** wrap an `<a>` tag inside a `<button>` â€” itâ€™s invalid HTML
- For vertical centering with Flexbox, always set the parentâ€™s height (e.g., `100vh`)

## Day 2 â€” Responsive Layout Practice

- Learned how to create a responsive webpage layout using flexbox and CSS Grid  
- Built a multi-column layout with a sidebar and main content area  
- Used media queries to adjust project grid columns for wide and narrow screens  
- Practiced styling navigation with hover effects  
- Improved understanding of layout structuring with semantic HTML tags  
- Tips learned: 
  - Use flex ratios (`flex: 0.7`, `flex: 0.3`) to control column widths  
  - Use `grid-template-columns` to control number of grid columns  
  - Hover effects can be applied on nav or individual links depending on UX needs  

Overall, this exercise helped me strengthen foundational skills in responsive design and CSS layout techniques.
