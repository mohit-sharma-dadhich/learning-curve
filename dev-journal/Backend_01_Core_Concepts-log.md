# Backend Core Concepts Log

## ‚úÖ 1. What is Backend?

The **backend** is the **server-side** of a web application.

It handles:

- **Business logic**
- **Database operations**
- **Processing client requests**

It sends **responses** back to the frontend.

It is not directly visible to the user, but it powers everything behind the scenes.

## ‚úÖ 2. Difference Between Server & Client

| Term      | Description                                                      |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Client** | The **user-side** (browser/app) that sends requests to a server |
| **Server** | The **backend-side** that receives and responds to those requests |

### üîÑ Request-Response Flow:
1. **Client** sends a request  
2. **Server** receives and processes it  
3. **Server** returns a response

### üîç Examples:
- **Client**: Chrome browser, React app  
- **Server**: Node.js backend, Express app

### üîë Key Differences:

| Feature    | Client                            | Server                             |
|------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Runs on    | User‚Äôs browser or app              | Hosting/server machine             |
| Role       | Sends requests                     | Receives and handles requests      |
| Example    | Requests a webpage                 | Sends back HTML/data as response   |

## ‚úÖ 3. HTTP & HTTPS Protocols

### üåê HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Protocol for communication between **client and server**
- **Stateless** and **text-based**
- Uses **port 80** - by default
- Example: `GET /products` request

### üîê HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
- HTTP + **SSL/TLS encryption**
- Provides **secure and encrypted communication**
- Uses **port 443** - by default 
- Essential for **login, payments, user data**

### üßæ Common HTTP Methods:

| Method   | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `GET`    | Retrieve data            |
| `POST`   | Submit data              |
| `PUT`    | Replace existing data    |
| `PATCH`  | Partially update data    |
| `DELETE` | Remove data              |

## ‚úÖ 4. Request-Response Lifecycle

The request-response lifecycle is how a **client (browser or app)** communicates with a **server** over the web.


### üîÑ Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Client Sends a Request**
   - Triggered by user actions (clicking a link, submitting a form, API call)
   - Contains:
     - **HTTP method** (GET, POST, etc.)
     - **URL** (endpoint)
     - **Headers** (e.g., content-type, auth tokens)
     - Optional **body** (data sent with POST, PUT)

2. **Server Receives the Request**
   - Matches the **route** and **method**
   - Extracts any params, queries, or body data
   - Applies **business logic** or queries the **database**

3. **Server Sends a Response**
   - Sends back:
     - A **status code** (e.g., 200, 404, 500)
     - A **body** (e.g., HTML page, JSON data, file, etc.)

4. **Client Receives the Response**
   - The browser renders the page or the app updates its UI
   - Response can be handled using JavaScript (e.g., `fetch()`)



### üì¶ Real-world Example:

- **Request**:  
  `GET /products` ‚Üí Client wants a list of products  
  Sent with method `GET`, to the server's `/products` route.

- **Server Logic**:  
  Looks up product list from database.

- **Response**:  
  `200 OK` + JSON array of products



### üí° Key Notes:

- Every interaction between client and server follows this pattern.
- HTTP is **stateless**, so each request is independent.
- This flow is used in both traditional websites and APIs.

## ‚úÖ 5. REST & RESTful APIs

### üîó What is REST?

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**. It‚Äôs just a set of rules or principles that help us design APIs.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let the frontend (client) talk to the backend (server).

When an API follows REST rules, we call it a **RESTful API**.



### üìå Core REST Principles:

- **Stateless**: Each request is independent; server stores no session info.
- **Client-Server**: Frontend and backend are separated.
- **Uniform Interface**: All requests follow a consistent structure.
- **Resource-Based**: Data is accessed via URL endpoints (e.g., `/users`)
- **Uses HTTP Methods**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`



### üß± Example RESTful Routes for `/users`:

| Method   | Route         | Description            |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/users`      | Get all users          |
| `GET`    | `/users/:id`  | Get a user by ID       |
| `POST`   | `/users`      | Create a new user      |
| `PUT`    | `/users/:id`  | Update entire user     |
| `PATCH`  | `/users/:id`  | Update partial user    |
| `DELETE` | `/users/:id`  | Delete a user          |


### üéØ Why Use RESTful APIs?

- Platform-independent (works with web/mobile)
- Easy to test using tools like Postman
- Based on standard HTTP methods and URIs

---

## ‚úÖ 6. CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

CRUD defines the 4 basic operations to manage data in a backend system.

### üîπ CRUD Breakdown:

| Operation | HTTP Method | Description              | Example Route             |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Create**| `POST`      | Add new data             | `POST /users`             |
| **Read**  | `GET`       | Retrieve data            | `GET /users`, `/users/:id`|
| **Update**| `PUT/PATCH` | Modify existing data     | `PUT /users/:id`          |
| **Delete**| `DELETE`    | Remove data              | `DELETE /users/:id`       |

### üí° Notes:
- `PUT`: Replaces full object
- `PATCH`: Updates part of the object
- CRUD operations are the core of any RESTful API

---
## ‚úÖ 7. HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are 3-digit numbers returned by the server to tell the client the result of a request.


### üìä Status Code Categories:

| Range   | Type           | Description                              |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1xx     | Informational  | Request received, keep going             |
| 2xx     | Success        | Request was successful                   |
| 3xx     | Redirection    | Further action needed (e.g., redirect)   |
| 4xx     | Client Error   | Issue with request from the client side  |
| 5xx     | Server Error   | Issue with server while handling request |


### ‚úÖ Common Status Codes:

| Code | Meaning               | Example Use Case                         |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `200` | OK                    | Data fetched successfully                |
| `201` | Created               | Resource created via `POST`              |
| `204` | No Content            | Successful request but no response data  |
| `400` | Bad Request           | Invalid or missing input                 |
| `401` | Unauthorized          | No valid auth token                      |
| `403` | Forbidden             | Client is not allowed access             |
| `404` | Not Found             | Resource or route not found              |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Bug or crash on server                   |
| `503` | Service Unavailable   | Server is overloaded or under maintenance|

## ‚úÖ 8. Tools: Postman & Thunder Client

API testing tools help developers send HTTP requests directly to the backend and inspect responses without needing a frontend UI.

---

### üîß Postman:
- Standalone application for testing REST APIs
- Supports all HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Allows:
  - Custom headers
  - Request body (JSON, form-data)
  - Authentication tokens
- Useful for saving and reusing API requests (collections)

---

### üîß Thunder Client:
- VS Code extension for testing APIs
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to use
- Good for quick local development testing
- Supports all core API features similar to Postman

---

### üß™ Why Use These Tools?
- Test and debug backend APIs
- Validate responses and status codes
- No need to build frontend first
